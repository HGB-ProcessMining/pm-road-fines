# Project Title: Predictive Process Mining on Road Traffic Fine Management XES Event Log
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to use predictive process mining techniques to analyze the Road Traffic Fine Management event log (XES) and make predictions on whether fines were paid or not.

## Prerequisites
Python 3
Required libraries: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pm4py

## Data Exploration and Cleaning
The first step is to explore the data and clean it as necessary. This includes handling unusual cases and converting data into a format that can be used for modeling.

## Dataset Creation
The second step is to create datasets for each step in the traces. This includes creating a dataset for all first steps in traces, a dataset for all first and second steps, and so on. A total of 9 datasets were created for this project. You can see the Creation Process in the Picture below.
